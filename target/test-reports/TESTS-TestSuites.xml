  As a book owner
  I want to add books I own to the book tracker
  so that I do not have to remember them by myself

--Output from new book--
  Scenario: new book                               # NewBook.feature:6
    Given I open the book tracker                  # Book_Steps.groovy:5
    When I add "Specification by Example"          # Book_Steps.groovy:10
    Then I see "Specification by Example"s details # Book_Steps.groovy:14
